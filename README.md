# Lauri Huju's Portfolio

Here are links to some game projects I have made. All these projects are made using Unity and C#. In addition to these projects in this portfolio I have done some small guided projects in school.

### Dark Office

- A 3D horror game where the player travels from the first floor of an office building to the roof where a helicopter is waiting for the player. To move between floors, the player must use the elevator which requires the code found from the hidden code tag of each floor. In the floors 2-6, there is an enemy looking for the player.
- The project was made as a game jam game for the Finnish College Jam #3 in a team of four people.
